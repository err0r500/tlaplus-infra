---- MODULE UpdateCluster ----
EXTENDS Integers, FiniteSets

CONSTANTS  
    _Requests, \* the requests sent by the user
    _Workers, \* the pool of workers
    NULL

VARIABLES 
    lastVOK, \* last successfully applied version
    toApply, \* the version to apply (last request that passed the initial tests)
    cluster, \*  cluster state 
    requests, \* the state of all requests
    workers, \* the state of all workers
    clusterUpdating \* damn, I used a lock... 

VARIABLES 
    \* these variables are tla+ details
    confOK, \* are we able to get a valid conf ? 
    reqCounter \* just to keep track of the order of submissions
